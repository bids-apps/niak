% Template for the CONNECTOME pipeline
%
% To run this pipeline, the fMRI datasets first need to be preprocessed
% using the NIAK fMRI preprocessing pipeline, and a set of functional
% parcelations have to be generated using the BASC pipeline.

%% Grabbing the results from the NIAK fMRI preprocessing pipeline
opt_g.min_nb_vol = 100;     % The minimum number of volumes for an fMRI dataset to be included. This option is useful when scrubbing is used, and the resulting time series may be too short.
opt_g.min_xcorr_func = 0.5; % The minimum xcorr score for an fMRI dataset to be included. This metric is a tool for quality control which assess the quality of non-linear coregistration of functional images in stereotaxic space. Manual inspection of the values during QC is necessary to properly set this threshold.
opt_g.min_xcorr_anat = 0.5; % The minimum xcorr score for an fMRI dataset to be included.

Manual inspection of the values during QC is necessary to properly set this threshold.
