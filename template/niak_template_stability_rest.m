opt_g.min_nb_vol = 100;     % The minimum number of volumes for an fMRI dataset to be included. This option is useful when scrubbing is used, and the resulting time series may be too short.
opt_g.min_xcorr_func = 0.5; % The minimum xcorr score for an fMRI dataset to be included. This metric is a tool for quality control which assess the quality of non-linear coregistration of functional images in stereotaxic space. Manual inspection of the values during QC is necessary to properly set this threshold.
opt_g.min_xcorr_anat = 0.5; % The minimum xcorr score for an fMRI dataset to be included. This metric is a tool for quality control which assess the quality of non-linear coregistration of the anatomical image in stereotaxic space. Manual inspection of the values during QC is necessary to properly set this threshold.

%% !! ALTERNATIVE METHOD
%% Grab the results of the region growing pipeline.
%% If the region growing pipeline has already been executed on this database, it is possible to start right out from its outputs.
%% To use this alternative method, uncomment the following line and suppress the block of code above ("Grabbing the results from the NIAK fMRI preprocessing pipeline")
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% files_in = niak_grab_region_growing('/home/toto/database/region_growing');

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Extra infos
%% These have to be organized in a comma-separated file (CSV). Example:
%%          , sex
%% subject1 , 0
%% subject2 , 1
%%
%% Note that the first entry has to be left empty. The subject IDs need to be identical to those used in the fMRI preprocessing pipeline.
%% Also, only numerical variables are supported (i.e. no 'M', 'W' to code for man and woman).
%% These variables will be used to split the subjects into strata, e.g. men vs women. In the group analysis, equal weight is given to all strata
%% (regardless of the number of subjects). Resampling of subjects is also made within strata, but not between them. Adding more covariates
%% will further stratify the group sample (e.g. two variables old/young men/women will translate into 4 strata).
%%
%% If you want to stratify the sample, uncomment the following line and indicate the csv file you want to use. Otherwise, just leave it as is.
%% To check that the file is properly formatted prior to running the pipeline, run the following command in Matlab/Octave:
%% [tab,labx,laby] = niak_read_csv('/data/infos.csv');
%% The subject IDs should load in LABX, the covariate IDs load in LABY, and the value of the variables into a numerical array TAB.
