% SUMMARY NIAK_BRICK_CLEAN
%
% Clean up files (used to get rid of some intermediate outputs in a
% pipeline)
%
% SYNTAX:
% [FILES_IN,FILES_OUT,OPT] = NIAK_BRICK_CLEAN(FILES_IN,FILES_OUT,OPT)
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS
%
%  * FILES_IN
%       (string, cell of string or structure)
%       A list of files that need to exist before the clean up can start.
%       The files can be organized as a cell of strings or nested
%       structures. Typically, in a pipeline, you may want to clean the
%       outputs of stage N when stage N+1 is complete.
%       In this case, FILES_IN would be the list of outputs at stage N+1.
%
%  * FILES_OUT
%       (empty cell) This field is ignored. The clean-up does not produce
%       any output.
%
%  * OPT
%       (structure) with the following fields :
%
%       CLEAN
%           (string, cell of string or structure) A list of files that
%           need to be cleaned up. The files can be organized as a
%           cell of strings or nested structures.
%           Typically, in a pipeline, you may want to clean the outputs of
%           stage N when stage N+1 is complete. In this case, OPT.CLEAN
%           would be the list of outputs at stage N.
%
%       FLAG_VERBOSE
%           (boolean, default 1) if the flag is 1, then the function
%           prints some infos during the processing.
%
%       FLAG_TEST
%           (boolean, default 0) if FLAG_TEST equals 1, the brick does not
%           do anything but update the default values in FILES_IN,
%           FILES_OUT, and OPT.
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS
%
% If the files in FILES_IN do not exist, the function simply issues a
% warning and quit.
%
% If the files in FILES_IN exist, the files in OPT.CLEAN are deleted.
%
% The structures FILES_IN, FILES_OUT and OPT are updated with default
% valued. If OPT.FLAG_TEST == 0, the specified files in OPT.CLEAN are
% deleted.
