%% Grabbing the results from the NIAK fMRI preprocessing pipeline
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
opt_g.min_nb_vol = 100;     % The minimum number of volumes for an fMRI dataset to be included. This option is useful when scrubbing is used, and the resulting time series may be too short.
opt_g.min_xcorr_func = 0.5; % The minimum xcorr score for an fMRI dataset to be included. This metric is a tool for quality control which assess the quality of non-linear coregistration of functional images in stereotaxic space. Manual inspection of the values during QC is necessary to properly set this threshold.
opt_g.min_xcorr_anat = 0.5; % The minimum xcorr score for an fMRI dataset to be included. This metric is a tool for quality control which assess the quality of non-linear coregistration of the anatomical image in stereotaxic space. Manual inspection of the values during QC is necessary to properly set this threshold.
opt_g.exclude_subject = {'subject1','subject2'}; % If for whatever reason some subjects have to be excluded that were not caught by the quality control metrics, it is possible to manually specify their IDs here.
opt_g.type_files = 'fir'; % Specify to the grabber to prepare the files for the STABILITY_FIR pipeline
files_in = niak_grab_fmri_preprocess('/home/toto/database/fmri_preprocess',opt_g); % Replace the folder by the path where the results of the fMRI preprocessing pipeline were stored.

%% Event times
%% A standard FSL event time in the form of a comma-separated values file will do.
%%
%% time , duration , amplitude
%% 3.5  , 4        , 1
%% 10   , 3.8      , 1
%%
%% Note that the two last columns are ignored. It is also possible to use a csv file with multiple
%% conditions "a la NIAK"
%%
%%         , time , duration , amplitude
%% neutral , 3.5  , 4        , 1
%% pain    , 10   , 3.5      , 1
%% neutral , 15   , 4.2      , 1
%%
%% Again the two last columns are ignored. The name of the condition of interest is specified with OPT.NAME_CONDITION (by default
%% it is using the first condition).
%% One last comment is that it is possible to specify the same model for all subjects and runs, or a different model for each subject/session/run.
