% Order objects based on a partition
%
% SYNTAX :
% [ORDER,PART_ORDER,ORDER_C] = NIAK_PART2ORDER(PART,S)
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS :
%
% PART
%       (vector length N) find(PART==I) defines the elements in cluster I
%
% S
%       (array, size N*N) a similarity matrix on which the clustering is
%       based.
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS :
%
% ORDER
%       (vector) defines a permutation on the objects to maximize
%       similarity between neighbours.
%
% PART_ORDER
%       (vector) same as part, but the clusters have been re-ordered to
%       match the order found in ORDER.
%
% ORDER_C
%		(vector) defines the order on the cluster.
% _________________________________________________________________________
% COMMENTS :
%
% The algorithm is as follows. First the average similarity between
% clusters is derived. The cluster with largest difference between his most
% similar alter-cluster and his second most similar alter-cluster is
% selected to initialize a chain. Iteratively, for each element of the
% chain, the most similar alter-cluster is selected as the next element of
% the chain, after eliminating all preceding member of the chain from the
% competition.
%
% Then, for each cluster D and for each point x in D, let s(x,C1) and
% s(x,C2) be the average similarity between x and the points in C1 and
% C2 respecitvely, where C1, C2 are the "neighbours" of cluster D. The
% values s(x,C1)-s(x,C2) are sorted (ascending order) and define the
% order of points within D. Note that if C1 or C2 are undefined (D is
% the first or the last cluster), y1 or y2 is defined as 0.
%
% If some elements of PART equal 0, these points will be absent of ORDER
% and will be ignored in the computation.
