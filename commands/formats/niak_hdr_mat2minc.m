function [direction_cosine,step,start,dimension_order] = niak_hdr_mat2minc(mat)
% Convert a "voxel-to-world" coordinates affine transformation from the standard
% 4*4 matrix array (y=M*x+T) to the cosines/start/step representation used
% in minc headers.
%
% SYNTAX:
% [DIRECTION_COSINE,STEP,START,DIMENSION_ORDER] = NIAK_HDR_MAT2MINC(MAT)
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS:
%
% MAT   (4*4 array) An affine transformation, usually seen as a
%           "voxel-to-world" space transform.
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS:
%
% DIRECTION_COSINES (array 3*3) gives you the direction assigned to the
%           respective dimensions of the voxel array.
%
% START (vector 3*1) the starting value of each voxel dimension along the
%       DIRECTION_COSINES vector.
%
% STEP  (vector 3*1) the step made at each voxel dimension along the
%       DIRECTION_COSINES vector.
%
% DIMENSION_ORDER (string) the order in which the dimensions are stored.
%   Each letter ('x', 'y' or 'z') indicates a directions as follows:
%   x: left -> right; y: posterior -> anterior; z: dorsal -> ventral

% COMMENTS:
%
% This function is based on the description of MINC2 system of coordinates
% that can be found at :
% http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/MINC/Reference/MINC2.0_File_Format_Reference#MINC_2.0_coordinate_system
%
% There is however no recommended method for this operation in the official
% MINC2 API. This function is a hack that seems to work in all the
% situation that have been tested so far.
