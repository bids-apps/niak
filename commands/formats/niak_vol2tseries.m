% TSERIES = NIAK_VOL2TSERIES(VOL,MASK)
%
% VOL      (4D array) A 3D+t dataset.
% MASK     (3D volume, default all voxels) a binary mask of the voxels that
%          will be included in the time*space array.
% TSERIES  (2D array) a time*space array with the time series of the voxel in
%          MASK (in the same order as in find(MASK)).
