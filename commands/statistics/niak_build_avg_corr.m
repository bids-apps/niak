function avg_corr = niak_build_avg_corr(mat,part,flag_vec)
% Compute the average similarity within and between clusters. Note that the
% within-cluster similiarity of a singleton is arbitrarily set to zero.
%
% AVG_CORR = NIAK_BUILD_AVG_CORR(MAT,PART,[FLAG_VEC])
%
% MAT (array, size S*L) MAT(s,:) is a vectorized correlation matrix (with NIAK_MAT2VEC)
% PART (vector, size N*1) PART(I) is the number of the cluster unit I
%   belongs to, ie the elements of cluster K are defined by FIND(PART==K).
% AVG_SIM (matrix) AVG_SIM(:,L2) is the average correlation matrix between clusters
%   vectorized with NIAK_MAT2LVEC
