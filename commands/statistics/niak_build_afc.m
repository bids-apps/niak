function afc = niak_build_afc(tseries,part,flag_vec)
% Compute the average functional connectivity (AFC) within and between
% networks given a set of regional time series and a partition of regions
% into networks. Functional connectivity simply refers to the linear
% Pearson's correlation coefficient between time series.
%
% SYNTAX:
% AFC = NIAK_BUILD_AFC(TSERIES,PART,FLAG_VEC)
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS:
%
% TSERIES
%       (2D array) tseries(:,i) is the time series of the ith region
%
% PART
%       (vector) find(part==j) is the list of region in network j. In other
%       words, part(i) is the number of the network of region i.
%
% FLAG_VEC
%       (boolean, default false) if FLAG_VEC == true, the output matrix is
%       "vectorized" and the redundant elements are suppressed. Use
%       NIAK_VEC2MAT to unvectorize it.
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS:
%
% AFC
%       (matrix or vector) is the vectorized matrix of intra/inter networks
%       average functional connectivity. See NIAK_MAT2LVEC and DNM_LVEC2MAT
%       for going from vectorized to matrix form.
