function ovlp = niak_build_ovlp_partition(part1,part2,method);
% Compute the relative overlap between two partitions
%
% SYNTAX:
% OVLP = NIAK_BUILD_CORRELATION(PART1,PART2)
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS:
%
% PART1
%   (vector) PART1(I) is the number of the 1st partition for element I.
%
% PART2
%   (vector) PART2(I) is the number of the 2nd partition for element I.
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS:
%
% OVLP
%   (vector) OVLP(I) is the relative overlap between PART1 and PART2 at
%   element I (see COMMENTS below).

% COMMENTS:
%
% Let K = PART1(I) and L = PART2(I). Let C = (PART1==K) be the cluster that
% contains I in the first partition, and D = (PART2==K) be the cluster that
% contains I in the second partition. Finally, let #C (resp. #D) be the
% number of elements in C (resp. D). The relative overlap at I is defined
% as :
%
% OVLP(I) = #(C&D)/max(#C,#D)
