function r = niak_corr(x,y);
% Correlation between two set of time series
% SYNTAX: R = NIAK_CORR(X,Y)
% X (matrix TxM) random samples (each column is a variable)
% Y (matrix TxN) random samples (each column is a variable)
% R (matrix MxN) R(i,j) is the correlation between X(:,i) and Y(:,j)
%
% This function does simply call corr. Correlation values larger than 1
% (resp smaller than -1) are then set to 1 (resp. -1), due to numerical errors.
