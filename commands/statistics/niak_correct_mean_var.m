function tseries_n = niak_correct_mean_var(tseries,type_correction)
% Correct time series to zero mean and unit variance
%
% SYNTAX:
% TSERIES_N = NIAK_CORRECT_MEAN_VAR(TSERIES,TYPE_CORRECTION)
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS:
%
% TSERIES_N
%       (2D array) each column of TSERIES is a time series.
%
% TYPE_CORRECTION
%       (string, default 'mean_var') possible values :
%           'none' : no correction at all
%           'mean' : correction to zero mean.
%           'mean_var' : correction to zero mean and unit variance
%           'mean_var2' : same as 'mean_var' but slower, yet does not use
%               as much memory).
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS :
%
% TSERIES_N             (2D array) same as data after mean/variance correction.
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% COMMENTS :
%
% time series with zero variance are left as constant zeros.
