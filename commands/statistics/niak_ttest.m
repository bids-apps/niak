function [ttest_local,pvalues,mean_eff,std_eff,df] = niak_ttest(X,Y,flag_two_tailed)
% Massively univariate t-tests.
%
% SYNTAX :
% [TTEST,PVALUES,MEAN_EFF,STD_EFF,DF] = NIAK_TTEST(X,Y,FLAG_TWO_TAILED)
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS:
%
% X, Y
%   (data array, size T*N) Each column is a series of independent
%   observations of a variable.
%   if only X is provided (or Y is empty) the function implements a one-sample t-test,
%   against a zero mean.
%   if X and Y are provided the function implements a two sample t-test with
%   unequal variance and size.
%
% FLAG_TWO_TAILED
%   (boolean, default true) if the flag is true, implements a two-tailed test.
%   Otherwise it is one tailed, mean(X) > 0 for one-sample or
%   (mean(Y)>mean(X)) for two-sample.
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS:
%
% TTEST
%   (vector, size 1*N) a one sample t-test of significance of the mean
%   of the columns of X against 0 (case where Y was not specified) OR a two
%   sample t-test on the difference of the mean of X and Y.
%   TTEST is MEAN_EFF./STD_EFF, see below.
%
% PVALUES
%   (vector, size 1*N) the probability of obtaining a test statistic at
%   least as extreme as the one that was actually observed, assuming that
%   the null hypothesis is true.
%
% MEAN_EFF
%   (vector, size 1*N) the estimate of the mean (for one sample t-test) or
%   the differences between the mean of Y minus the mean of X (for two-
%   sample t-tests).
%
% STD_EFF
%   (vector, size 1*N) the standard deviation of MEAN_EFF.
%
% DF
%   (scaler for one-sample t-test, vector 1*N for two-sample t-test)
%   The degrees of freedom associated with each test.
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% COMMENTS:
%
% For A positive t-test is for mean of Y greater than mean of X.
