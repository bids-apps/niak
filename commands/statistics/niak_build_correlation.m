function [R,pce] = niak_build_correlation(tseries,flag_vec);
% Compute the correlation matrix from regional time series.
% R = NIAK_BUILD_CORRELATION(TSERIES,FLAG_VEC)
%
% TSERIES (array) time series. First dimension is time.
% FLAG_VEC (boolean, default false) if FLAG_VEC == true, the matrix is
%   "vectorized" and the redundant elements are suppressed. Use
%   NIAK_VEC2MAT to unvectorize it.
% R (square matrix or vector) Empirical correlation matrix. R is
%   symmetrical with ones on the diagonal.
% PCE (same size as R) PCE(i) is the p-value of significant testing of R,
%   under a Gaussian i.i.d. assumption.
