function std_mad = niak_mad(tseries);
% Median absolute deviation to the median.
% This function was designed for time series, and applies a correction
% factor to derive an estimate of the standard deviation for a Gaussian
% process
%
% SYNTAX:
% STD_MAD = NIAK_MAD(TSERIES)

% OUTPUTS:
%
% STD_MAD
%       (vector) STD_MAD(I) is a MAD estimate of the standard deviation of
