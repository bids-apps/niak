%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS:
%
% TSERIES
%   (2D array) TSERIES is a 2D array where each column of TSERIES is
%   a time series.
%
% CLUSTERS
%   (3D array or vector) cluster #I is equal to (CLUSTERS==I).
%
% ATOMS
%   (same size as clusters) the Kth time series is associated with (ATOMS==K).
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS :
%
% TSERIES_M
%       (2D array) TSERIES_M(:,I) is the average of all time series such
%       that (CLUSTERS==I) has an overlap with the associated ATOMS.
