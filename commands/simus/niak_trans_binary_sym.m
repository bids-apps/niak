% SUMMARY NIAK_TRANS_BINARY_SYM
%
% Return the probability of transition between states for binary symmetric
% and independent Markov chains of order 1.
%
% SYNTAX :
% P = NIAK_TRANS_BINARY_SYM(S,OPT)
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS:
%
% S
%       (binary vector, size 1*NB_CHAINS) S(N) is the (binary) state of
%       chain number N.
%
% OPT
%       (vector, size 1*NB_CHAINS) OPT(N) is the probability that chain N
%       stays in its current state. If OPT is a scalar, the same
%       probability will be used for all chains.
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS:
%
% PROB
%       (array, size 2*NB_UNITS) PROB(K,N) is the probability that chain N
%       will be in state K at next sample.
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% COMMENTS:
%
% States are coded by integers started at 0. For example, with NB_STATES =
% 2, S will be a binary array.
