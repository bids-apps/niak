function [tseries_f,extras] = niak_filter_tseries(tseries,opt)
% Filter time series using Discrete-Cosine (DC) least-square linear
% regression.
%
% SYNTAX: TSERIES_F = NIAK_FILTER_TSERIES(TSERIES,OPT)
%
% INPUTS:
%   TSERIES (2D array, size T*N) a time*space array of time series.
%   OPT.TR (real) the repetition time of the time series (s)
%   OPT.HP (real, default -Inf) the cut-off frequency for high pass
%      filtering. opt.hp = -Inf means no high-pass filtering.
%   OPT.LP (real, default Inf) the cut-off frequency for low pass
%      filtering. opt.lp = Inf means no low-pass filtering.
%   OPT.FLAG_MEAN (boolean, default: 0) if FLAG_MEAN is 1, the funtion does
%      leave the mean of the time series after filtering (it is otherwise
%      suppressed as soon as a high-pass filter is applied with a
%      threshold greater than 0).
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   TSERIES_F (2D array, size T*N) a time*space array of filtered tseries.
%   EXTRAS (structure) with the following fields :
%      TSERIES_DC_LOW (2D array, size T*Kl) a (time*nb cosines)
%         array of discrete cosines covering the frequency window that is
%         to be suppressed in high-pass filtering.
%      BETA_DC_LOW (2D ARRAY, size Kl*N) a (nb cosines * space)
%         array such that BETA_DC_LOW(k,n) is the weight of the
%         low-frequency discrete cosine number k at location n.
%      FREQ_DC_LOW (vector, size Kl*1) FREQ_DC_LOW(k) is the frequency
%         associated to cosine TSERIES_DC_LOW(:,k)
%      TSERIES_DC_HIGH (2D array, size T*Kh) a (time*nb cosines)
%         array of discrete cosines covering the frequency window that is
%         to be suppressed in low-pass filtering.
%      BETA_DC_HIGH (2D ARRAY, size Kl*N) a (nb cosines * space)
%         array such that BETA_DC_HIGH(k,n) is the weight of the
%         high-frequency discrete cosine number k at location n.
%      FREQ_DC_HIGH (vector, size Kl*1) FREQ_DC_HIGH(k) is the frequency
%         associated to cosine TSERIES_DC_HIGH(:,k)
%
