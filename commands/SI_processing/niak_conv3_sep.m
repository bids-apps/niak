% SUMMARY NIAK_CONV3_SEP
%
% 3D convolution of a volume with a separable kernel
%
% SYNTAX:
% VOL_C = NIAK_CONV3_SEP(VOL,FX,FY,FZ)
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% INPUTS:
%
% VOL
%       (3D array) a volume
%
% FX,FY,FZ
%       (1D array, odd length) the respective kernels in dimensions x, y
%       and z respectively. The first sample is for t=0, and the function
%       is assumed to be periodic (typically, the kernel has non-zero
%       values clustered in the extreme portions of the vector, and has
%       zeros in the middle par). The length of the kernel needs to be odd.
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS:
%
% VOL
%       (3D array) the (3D) convolution (FZ*FY*FZ)*VOL, where * is
%       convolution.
