% INPUT
% par               par(1) is the mean of the gaussian function
%                   par(2) is the standard deviation of the gaussian function
%
% OUTPUTS
% Ybis              value of the gaussian function with parameters par at X (global)
% y                 quadratic error between Ybis and Y (global)
