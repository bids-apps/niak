% Perform a principal component analysis on a 2D data array.

% SYNTAX:
% [EIG_VAL,EIG_VEC,WEIGHTS] = NIAK_PCA(DATA)
%

% INPUTS
%
% DATA
%   (2D array, size N*T) variables x samples data array. If data is a time
%   series array, the time would be the second dimension for a spatial PCA
%   (the variables here are the volumes), which corresponds to TSERIES' for
%   the usual NIAK conventions for array of time series.
%
% NB_COMP
%   (real number, default rank of TSERIES)
%   If NB_COMP is comprised between 0 and 1, NB_COMP is assumed to be the
%   percentage of the total variance that needs to be kept. If NB_COMP is
%   an integer, greater than 1, NB_COMP is the number of components that
%   will be generated (the procedure always consider the principal
%   components ranked according to the energy they explain in the data).
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUTS
%
% EIG_VAL
%   (vector, size NB_COMP*1) eigen values, which is also the energy
%   explained by each of the corresponding principal components.
%
% EIG_VEC
%   (array, size T*NB_COMP) eigen vectors (in columns)
%
% WEIGHTS
%   (array, size N*NB_COMP) the weights, i.e. the matrix such that
%   DATA = EIG_VEC*WEIGHTS' in the case where NB_COMP == T, and
%   otherwise EIG_VEC(:,1:NB_COMP)*WEIGHT(:,1:NB_COMP)' is simply the
%   projection of TSERIES in the PCA space of dimension NB_COMP with
%   maximal energy.

% COMMENTS:
%
% The PCA is done on the matrix of scalar products in the second
% dimension, i.e. DATA'*DATA.
