% SUMMARY NIAK_DEMO_SPCA
%
% This is a script to demonstrate the usage of :
% NIAK_BRICK_SPCA
%
% SYNTAX:
% Just type in NIAK_DEMO_SPCA
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% OUTPUT
% This script will run a spatial principal component analysis on the
% functional data of subject 1 (motor condition), and use the default names
% of the outputs.
%
% It will also select the independent components using a spatial prior map.
% and suppress the selected component (the spatial map is actually not in
% the same space as the functional data, so the selection is pretty random,
% but this is to demonstrate how to use the scripts).
%
% _________________________________________________________________________
% COMMENTS
%
% NOTE 1
% This script will clear the workspace !!
%
% NOTE 2
% Note that the path to access the demo data is stored in a variable
% called GB_NIAK_PATH_DEMO defined in the script NIAK_GB_VARS.
%
% NOTE 3
% The demo database exists in multiple file formats.NIAK looks into the demo
% path and is supposed to figure out which format you are intending to use
% by himself.You can the format by changing the variable GB_NIAK_FORMAT_DEMO
% in the script NIAK_GB_VARS.
