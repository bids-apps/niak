Other licenses and contributions:

 * The NIAK project was initiated by Pierre Bellec during his post-doctoral work in the laboratory of Alan C. Evans (ACElab), Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Canada. The initial design for NIAK was inspired by the CIVET pipeline developed in the ACElab.
 * Many of the functions of the NIAK depend on software developed over the years by members and collaborators of the BIC, the minc toolkit (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftware/ServicesSoftwareMincToolKit). The minc-toolkit is not part of NIAK and needs to be installed separately.
 * Several functions are adapted from fMRIstat developed by the late Pr [http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/ Keith Worsley]. *The pipeline system is a project called [http://code.google.com/p/psom/ PSOM] developed by Pierre Bellec (MIT license). PSOM is not part of the NIAK code base, but is bundled as part of the NIAK archive.
 * The connectome pipeline is based on the brain connectivity toolbox (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/). The BCT is not part of NIAK and needs to be installed separately.
 * The partial-volume estimation was generously contributed by Jussi Tohka, Tampere University of Technology, Finland (MIT license).
 * The processing of T1 scan is based on ideas and code generously shared by Claude Lepage and Oliver Lyttelton, from the ACElab, as well as Vladimir Fonov and Andrew Janke, from the laboratory of Louis Collins at the MNI, McGill University. (MINC license, which is an MIT-like license, see niak_bestlinreg.pl and niak_best1stepnlreg.pl)
 * The CORSICA method for correcting structured noise in fMRI was generously contributed by Vincent Perlbarg from the LIF Inserm U678 laboratory in Paris, directed by Dr Habib Benali (MIT license).
 * The mutli-dimensional scaling algorithm and implementation was generously contributed by [http://pgrc-16.ipk-gatersleben.de/~stricker/ Marc Strickert] as part of the NIAK project (MIT license).
 * The NIFTI reader/writer is adapted from a [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=8797&objectType=file code] by http://www.rotman-baycrest.on.ca/~jimmy/ Jimmy Shen.
 * The [http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/956 conversion] between rotation/translation and matrix representations of rigid-body motion by Giampiero Campa (BSD license).
 * The 'sinc' scheme for slice timing correction is a port from http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/ SPM. *The NIAK logo was adapted from an original work by the artist mattahan.deviantart.com/ Mattahan. *The spatial independent component analysis was extracted from http://sccn.ucsd.edu/fmrlab/ fMRlab.
 * The windowed Fourier transfrom is from the [http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~wavelab/ WaveLab] toolbox (license : non-standard).
